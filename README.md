# LoggerControllerDb is software for the Domestic Solar Hot Water installation described at:
GreenAndBluePlanet.com.
It is intended for a RaspberryPi with MySql installed although without operational data can
be written to a file (or not at all).
The programs evolved until the web portal provided the remote view of the system performance
required by the solar power experimentor.
